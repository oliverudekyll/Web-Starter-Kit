            Thank you so much for joining us today. I'm very-very glad to start
            this series of lectures with you two. So I've introduced the
            assignment already and the project to the students, it's a question
            revolving around the term neutrality in the field of graphic design,
            which I believe is a term that can be put in perspective,
            questioned, or criticized.
          </p>
          <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
            I'm gonna read a biography of you and your practice and what I
            propose is that either we exchange on a question-answer mode or you
            present and then we ask questions.

          <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
            We're really interested to have a discussion with you but also we
            could give you a kind of quick and dense presentation of our work.
            It's either or, I mean, you know, we can go straight in questions
            also.

            Sounds perfect! Then I will read your bio and then maybe start with
            the first question, which will then I'm sure evolve into your
            presentation, right?.

            So correct me if I'm wrong with the bio, I copied it from somewhere.
            You let me know if there are some updates in between.

            So, graphic designers Elizabeth Rafstedt and Johanna Ehde form
            Rietlanden Women's Office. Their practice is interested in current
            and historical issues connected to reproductive work and
            collaborative graphic design. The basis of their work is a printed
            publication series called MsHeresies that we have here that the
            students looked at already. Inquiry into collaborative graphic
            design practices and the ornament as a form of work critique and the
            ornament sits at the center of their practice, where they consider
            ornaments not simply as added decoration but as traces of the
            specific conditions under which a work was made. They look at the
            traces of reproductive work, such as lines of alteration and
            correction, flashing elements, improvise type, manifestations of
            urgency, become the ornaments which makes social relations legible.
            The search for ornaments, disruptive, diffuse and aesthetic
            qualities, and sketch the ornament as a point where aesthetics and
            politics intertwine.

            Maybe we can start this presentation by you presenting yourselves,
            maybe, and now we had a bit of a glimpse into your practice, but
            what we're curious to hear is well, firstly who you are, how your
            collaboration works and maybe you can start talking about

            Okay, so we thought of this, when you came with this topic of the
            neutral and the connection to neutrality and graphic design. We also
            wanted to start here in our studio because it was sharing space
            together that made us form a group after our studies.

            Basically, maybe this introduction to our work, we can start with
            the work and then we can speak a little bit more about why we have
            chosen to have a collective practice. But what you can see on the
            screen now is a poster
            <img

            that was supposed to be shown in Leipzig at the modern Museum of Art
            there at this very moment, in connection to the book, the Buchmesse,
            the book fair in Leipzig that they have there yearly. And it is a
            republishing of a Palestinian poet and her name is Hila Abunnada and
            she was murdered, she was killed during the bombings of her home in
            Gaza. The text comes from a publishing platform that you should
            really look upâ€”GazaPassages.orgâ€”and it's a publishing project called
            Passages Through Genocide. And they asked for everyone to republish
            and distribute the work from these Palestinian poets. On this poster
            it reads from the 8th of October last year. It reads, and this is
            Hila Abunnada, the writer, she wrote "Our news feeds of funeral
            homes, memorial services, obituary pages, we move from page to page
            as if walking through a square full of funerals packed side-by-side.
            God, the weight of these days." And this poster is not shown in
            Leipzig now because it is not neutral.
